## Objectives

- Progressing in [AstralArchive Project](https://github.com/khanz1/Project-AstralArchive)
- Progressing in [CelestialGate Project](https://github.com/khanz1/Project-CelestialGate)

## What am I doing

### Progressing in AstralArchive Project

So what is AstralArchive Project?

> AstralArchive is an innovative web development project that serves as a celestial repository for storing images, videos, and various media. Inspired by cosmic wonders and Greek mythology, the project brings forth HyperionVault, a secure and expansive storage solution that echoes the grandeur of celestial realms.

_sounds impossible collection of words? yes it is!, because I am using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to generate it haha._

so basically it is a project to store/host a file to a storage bucket, here I am using [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage)
of course not only a static file, but to get a file we need a server `at least until this time, it is what I know`.

I am using CelestialGate API to do upload and AstralArchive to download or get the file.
In a deep breath, I am using package `@supabase/supabase-js` SDK to communicate with Supabase API.

to do the upload as simple as
```javascript
async function uploadFile(file) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file)
  if (error) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Handle success
  }
}
```

but here I am the troublesome one, [I am create it as complecated as its](https://github.com/khanz1/Project-CelestialGate/blob/95f1bd84e3e0e77e650cf67623d5d9d2d54f267e/src/apis/astral-archive/astral-archive.service.ts#L55)

the plan is to host the web on https://cdn.khanz1.dev
and the operation of create and such on https://api.khanz1.dev/astral-archive
and the interface on https://celestia.khanz1.dev or we called it as admin page


### Progressing in CelestialGate Project

> CelestialGate emerges as a visionary API gateway, seamlessly connecting and harmonizing a constellation of web development services with the grace of celestial wonders and the power of Greek mythology. This project envisions a gateway that transcends conventional boundaries, channeling the energy of the cosmos and the resilience of mythological realms.

_yes it also generated by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)._

the goals of this project is simple, it would be a collection of api. from auth to manythings.

the progress for project `AstralArchive` is almost done, but there some things left to do. like the user should be authenticated, create a log of upload and download, and many more.
and the additional thing is I creating an auth service, the plan is using google login first because it more simple.
